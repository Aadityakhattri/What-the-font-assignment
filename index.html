                I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah <br>
                P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah <br>
                Milli point two just to hurt you, ah <br>
                All red Lamb' just to tease you, ah <br>
                None of these toys on lease too, ah <br>
                Made your whole year in a week too, yah <br>
                <span class="yelling">Main bitch outta your league too, ah</span> <br>

                <span class="sad">House so empty, need a centerpiece</span> <br>
                Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony <br>
                Cut that ivory into skinny pieces <br>
                <span class="sad">Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah</span> <br>
                You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid <br>
                <span class="yelling">You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade</span> <br>
                Switch up my style, I take any lane <br>

                Every day, a nigga try to test me, ah <br>
                Every day, a nigga try to end me, ah <br>
                Pull off in that Roadster SV, ah <br>
                Pockets overweight, gettin' hefty, ah <br>
                Comin' for the king, that's a far cry, I <br>
                I come alive in the fall time, I <br>
                The competition, I don't really listen <br>
                I'm in the blue Mulsanne, bumpin' New Edition <br>

                Let a nigga brag Pitt <br>
                Legend of the fall, took the year like a bandit <br>
                Bought Mama a crib and a brand new wagon <br>
                Now she hit the grocery shop lookin' lavish <br>
                Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan <br>
                Girls get loose when they hear this song <br>
                A hundred on the dash get me close to God <br>
                We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars <br>
